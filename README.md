# Global Trends in Forest Area (% of Land Area)

This repository explores global trends in **forest area as a percentage of total land area**. Sourced from the **World Bank**, this dataset provides valuable insights into deforestation, reforestation, and the state of natural resources across regions over the years.

## 🌍 Dataset Overview
- **Metric**: Percentage of land area covered by forests.
- **Source**: [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/)
- **Time Span**: Varies by country but spans several decades.
- **Geographical Coverage**: Worldwide.

## 📊 Key Questions to Explore
1. Which countries or regions have the largest forest cover as a percentage of land area?
2. How has forest area changed globally and regionally over the decades?
3. What are the relationships between forest area and other factors such as CO2 emissions or population density?

## 🚀 Potential Applications
